# Contract Management System Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of the contract management system that includes approval workflows, electronic signatures, billing configurations, and expiration alerts according to the specified requirements.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Contract Approval Workflow

A formal four-step approval workflow has been implemented:
- **Submission by Commercial Team** - The commercial team creates contract drafts using editable templates
- **Legal Review** - Contracts are reviewed by the legal team for compliance and legal validation
- **Commercial Review** - Once approved by legal, the commercial team performs a secondary review
- **Director Approval** - Final approval by the director before the contract becomes active

### 2. Automatic Electronic Signature

- After director approval, the system automatically sends the contract for electronic signature
- Leverages the existing AutentiqueService for handling document signatures
- Signatures can be collected via WhatsApp or email, making the process accessible and legally binding
- Automatic identification of signers from both the contractable entity and Invicta

### 3. Contract Expiration Alerts

- Implemented a comprehensive alert system that notifies stakeholders 90 days before contract expiration
- Set up recurring reminders if contracts are not renewed after the initial notification
- Alert frequency increases as the expiration date approaches
- Notifications are sent to relevant stakeholders including the commercial team, contract creator, and entity representatives

### 4. Billing Rules Configuration

- Added support for defining billing frequency (daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly, quarterly)
- Implementation of payment terms tracking with configurable payment period
- Contracts can be associated with specific billing rules for automated invoice generation

### 5. Extemporaneous Negotiation Management

- Created functionality for handling exceptional negotiations outside of formal contracts
- Automatic alerts to the commercial team (specifically Adla) when such negotiations are requested
- Tracking of addendums needed to formalize these exceptional arrangements

## Technical Implementation

The implementation includes:

1. **Database Updates**
   - Added fields to the contracts table to support new features:
     - alert_days_before_expiration, last_alert_sent_at, alert_count
     - billing_frequency, payment_term_days, billing_rule_id

2. **Job System for Alerts**
   - ContractExpirationAlert job handles initial notifications
   - RecurringContractExpirationAlert job handles follow-up reminders

3. **Updated Controllers**
   - ContractApprovalController manages the 4-step approval workflow
   - ContractController includes billing configuration options
   - ExtemporaneousNegotiationController supports exception handling

4. **Notification System**
   - ContractExpirationNotification sends detailed alerts via email and in-system messages

## Next Steps

1. Front-end implementation to support these features
2. User acceptance testing of the complete workflow
3. Create documentation for users on how to use the new contract management system
